I started this project by first writing the respective HTML codes and CSS styling. 

### Built With

### What I Learned 

I practiced my knowledge of html and css in building an interactive form wrapped in different major parts of the form in fieldset elements giving each one it's own legend.

And having both up and down arrow in select input field using css styling.
